# REST_API_Express_Build
REST API Build, using mongoDB for data storage. Express for all the heavy lifting.


## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.  


## Prerequisites
What dependencies you need to install the software and how to install them as followed

1. **NodeJS** - As an asynchronous event driven JavaScript runtime, Node is designed to build scalable network applications.
   - Learn more : https://nodejs.org/en/about/
2. **Npm** - npm makes it easy for JavaScript developers to share and reuse code, and makes it easy to update the code that youâ€™re sharing, so you can build amazing things.
   - Learn more : https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
3. **Express** - Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications
    - Learn more : https://expressjs.com/
4. **MongoDB** - MongoDB is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era. No database is more productive to use.
    - Learn more : https://www.mongodb.com/
5. **PostMan** - App for interacting with HTTP APIs. It presents you with a friendly GUI for constructing requests and reading responses. 
    - Learn more : https://www.getpostman.com/


1. **Homebrew** - Homebrew installs packages to their own directory and then symlinks their files into /usr/local.
   - Learn more - https://brew.sh

* Recommended install with **brew**.
   - past the following into your Terminal  
```
$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

**Install nodeJS & npm with brew** : past the following into your terminal
```
$ brew update && upgrade
```
```
$ brew install node
```
* After install is complete check install using the following in your terminal.  
For **node** - ```node -v``` this will print out a version number like this ```v10.6.0```.  
Now do the same for **npm** as followed ```npm -v``` output will look something like this ```6.2.0```.

```

* Recommended install & usage of this product with **PostMan**.

## Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.  
### 1. Step One  
  In project root dir ***('./')*** use the following command in your terminal.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/brandonv98/REST_API_Express_Build.git
```
### 2. Step Two
  Once you have cloned the repo ```$ cd/projectFolder ``` from here type ```$ npm install ``` to install all of the project dependencies.
### 3. Step Three
  Once completed run the following command in a new terminal window to start mongoDB.
  ```
  $ mongod
  ```
### 4. Step Four 
  Back in our Terminal run ```npm start``` to start our server on localhost:5000.

### 5. Recommended
  Send all requests threw PostMan to interact with this project.

#### Example && Demo of usage.

1. Example of get(/api/user) route, on request using PostMan.
    - Once user is created send get request with Basic Auth & valid credentials. Response is as followed.
``` js
{       
   _id: "User ID number",
   fullName: "Name of logged in user",
   emailAddress: "Users email address",
